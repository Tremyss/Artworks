# JOURNEY PROJECT
DIFFICULTY: 4.3
USEFULNESS: 4.3
FUN: 3.4
MATERIALS: 3.1

## STORY
Your millionaire art connoisseur friend has hired you and your team, to create a website for them.

## What are you going to learn?
Parallel working

## TASKS
### Frontend
Create the frontend of this project. Create a list and a single (end) page for the artworks.
There is a list page where artworks are listed.
Page visitors can browse, search artworks.
Artworks have their own page with all their details.
### Authentication and save data
Let registered users save their favorite artworks.
There is a user management system (register/login) with authorization. Authorization could be third party (Google, Facebook) or Email/Password.
Logged in users can save (mark as favorite) artworks.
There is a list page where users saved artworks are listed.
Users can browse, search in their saved artworks. Users saved artworks are stored in a database (as well as other user data).

## HINTS
Don't forget to select a UI/UX design from Behance which you'll use as a style guide in the project
You can use Material UI, Tailwind, or other Design Libraries as well (but it's recommended to customize it)
You can use the Example API server (linked in bg. materials) as a backend for this project
"Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning" is a funny quote, meaning you should carefully plan the whole project first before jumping into coding
You don't need to use the example APIs, you can find another one you prefer
